![Screenshot 2024-09-17 111304](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/868cbf26-a411-4d1a-98ee-7003b5496d8f)

**Morpheus IOC Scanner** is a tool designed to detect and analyze potentially malicious files, including ransomware and other Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). It uses custom-made rules to extract file-related information, alongside high-quality YARA rules that are widely used in enterprise environments to detect malware.

**This tool is still in heavy development and is currently not ready to be used. Several updates are ongoing**

## Modes of Operation

1. **VirusTotal Scan (API Key Required)**  
   Submit a file or hash to VirusTotal for an in-depth analysis using multiple antivirus engines. This mode provides comprehensive information about potential threats using VirusTotal's extensive database.

2. **Default Scan (YARA/Pefile)**  
   Perform a static scan using YARA rules and Pefile to identify common malicious patterns. This method can quickly flag suspicious files, including the custom detection of **KRYPT0S**, a ransomware developed as a proof of concept (POC).

## Installation

To get started with **Morpheus IOC Scanner**, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
	```bash 
	pip install -r requirements.txt  
	```
 2. Set up the YARA database for Morpheus by running the setup file:
	```python
	python3 setup.py
	```
3. Once setup is complete, you can run the main file (currently still in development, but the VirusTotal API feature is functional):
	```python
	python3 morpheus_scanner.py
	```
 
*Periodically run '''database_updater.py''' to fetch the latest YARA rules. If any updates have been made to the repository, the script will automatically download the newest rules.*

** Note: The VirusTotal integration is fully functional, while other features are still under development. **

## Features

- **Custom Detection for KRYPT0S Ransomware**:  
  Includes tailored detection for the KRYPT0S ransomware POC. This project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/phantom0004/KRYPT0S-Ransomware_POC).
  
- **High-Quality YARA Rules**:  
  Uses enterprise-grade YARA rules to detect malware, allowing thorough and reliable scanning.

- **File Information Extraction**:  
  Extract detailed file-related information through custom-made rules designed for comprehensive file analysis.

- **Up to Date Yara Rules**:
  Morpheus utilizes a custom script to instantly fetch new Yara rules whenever updates occur in the GitHub repository.

- **VirusTotal Integration**:  
  Optionally integrate with VirusTotal to leverage multi-engine analysis for deeper insight into potential threats.

## How to Get Started

### VirusTotal API Key (Optional):
To use VirusTotal scanning:
1. **Sign up at VirusTotal**: [VirusTotal Sign Up](https://www.virustotal.com)
2. Retrieve your API key from your profile under "API Key".
3. Run the tool, choose the VirusTotal scan option, and paste your API key when prompted.

### Default Scan:
No additional setup is required for the default scan. Just run **Morpheus IOC Scanner** and choose the default scan option to analyze files with the built-in YARA rules and Pefile.
